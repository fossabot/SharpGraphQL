# Roadmap

## ‚úÖ Completed Features (Prototype)

**Core Infrastructure:**
- [x] GraphQL lexer (zero-allocation, spec-compliant)
- [x] GraphQL parser (full AST support)
- [x] GraphQL executor (queries + mutations)
- [x] Page-based storage (4KB pages, MessagePack)
- [x] MemTable write buffer (16MB, sorted dictionary)
- [x] Table metadata (schema, columns, relationships)

**Indexing System:**
- [x] Hash indexes (O(1) primary key lookups)
- [x] B-tree indexes (range queries, sorted scans)
- [x] Index manager (multi-index coordination)
- [x] Automatic primary key indexing
- [x] Index statistics and monitoring

**Schema-Driven Development:**
- [x] GraphQL schema parser (SDL ‚Üí table definitions)
- [x] Schema loader (automatic table creation)
- [x] JSON data loading (with validation)
- [x] Relationship detection (foreign key generation)
- [x] Type system (GraphQL ‚Üí database mapping)

**Performance Optimizations:**
- [x] LRU page cache (reduces disk I/O by 70-90%)
- [x] Batch relationship loading (eliminates N+1 queries)
- [x] Zero-copy I/O (Span<T>, ArrayPool)
- [x] Lock optimization (minimized contention)

**HTTP Server:**
- [x] GraphQL endpoint (/graphql)
- [x] Schema management endpoints (/schema/*)
- [x] Introspection support
- [x] Error handling (GraphQL-compliant)

**Testing & Examples:**
- [x] Comprehensive test suite (231 tests, 100% pass rate)
- [x] Star Wars example (complex relationships)
- [x] Performance benchmarks
- [x] Documentation and guides

## üîÑ In Progress

**Advanced Features:**
- [ ] Query result caching
- [ ] DataLoader pattern (full implementation)
- [ ] Composite indexes
- [ ] Schema migrations

## üìã Future Roadmap (Path to Production)

**High Priority:**
- [ ] Write-ahead logging (WAL) for crash recovery
- [ ] Transactions (ACID compliance)
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Query planner and optimization
- [ ] Production-grade error handling
- [ ] Performance testing under load
- [ ] Memory leak detection and fixes
- [ ] Comprehensive security audit

**Medium Priority:**
- [ ] Parallel query execution
- [ ] Column-oriented storage option
- [ ] Schema versioning
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions
- [ ] Backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Monitoring and metrics

**Low Priority:**
- [ ] Multi-database support
- [ ] Replication and clustering
- [ ] Advanced security features
- [ ] GraphQL Federation support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations (Prototype)

- **No WAL**: Data loss possible on unexpected shutdown
- **No Transactions**: ACID properties not guaranteed
- **Limited Concurrency**: Basic locking, not optimized for high concurrency
- **No Query Optimization**: Simple execution without cost-based optimization
- **Memory Management**: May not handle very large datasets efficiently
- **Error Recovery**: Limited crash recovery capabilities
- **Security**: Basic security model, not production-hardened
